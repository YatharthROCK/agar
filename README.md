# Agar

Agar is a simple blob game. You can play [an online version][web] which got [really popular][trends] recently.

It's written in [Processing][processing] ([a Python flavor][py], in fact); hence the name 'Agar': [_processed_][agar] algae.
This project was built by Yatharth Agarwal and inspired by Ava LaRocca's blob game.
