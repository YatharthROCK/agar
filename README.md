# Agar

Agar is a simple blob game. You can play [an online version][web] which got [really popular][trends] recently.

It's written in [Processing][processing] ([a Python flavor][py], in fact); hence the name 'Agar': [_processed_][agar] algae.
This project was built by Yatharth Agarwal and inspired by Ava LaRocca's blob game.

The game currently implements colorful blobs, simple collisions, avoiding spawning over other player, flashing berating messages on getting eaten, 8-way movement support, and multi-player with upto 3 local playable characters.
Yet to be worked on are elastic collisions, a larger grid than displayed on screen, and a smart AI.
